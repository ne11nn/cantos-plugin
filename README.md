# cantos (plugin)

**A self-improving, multi-agent assistant system for Claude Code — installable in one command.**

Most Claude Code setups are one agent with one long prompt. Cantos is an **orchestrator** that routes each request to the specialist assistant that owns it, each with its own skills and sub-agents — all as plain, editable markdown. Nothing is a black box, and it improves itself as you use it.

## How it works

```text
You
 │
 ▼
Cantos — the orchestrator. Reads each request and routes it to the owner:
 │
 ├─▶ folio    research & writing — finding sources, drafting, citations
 ├─▶ lyren    admin — email, calendar, tasks (always drafts; never sends without your OK)
 └─▶ pylon    engineering — apps, sites, games, extensions (builds, tests, ships)

      every assistant carries its own skills + sub-agents

/wrap ─▶ after a session, what it learned folds back into the system's own
         files — so Cantos sharpens over time instead of decaying.
```

One orchestrator, specialist assistants, a shared library of skills. This is the *installable* form of the full [Cantos](https://github.com/ne11nn/cantos) template, and you can read and edit every file it ships.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add ne11nn/cantos-plugin
/plugin install cantos@cantos-plugin
```

That's it. The plugin's skills and the `browser-agent` are now available in every session, and a SessionStart notice tells you how to bring up the full system.

## Two ways to run the system

| Command | What it does | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/cantos:init` | Scaffolds the **entire writable system** into your current project as real, git-tracked files (CLAUDE.md, the assistants, workflows, references, the self-improvement spine), then runs a short setup interview to personalize it. | The real install. Run once per project. This is the only mode where the system **persists and evolves** — `/wrap` and brain-file updates stick on disk, and every future session in that directory starts as Cantos automatically. |
| `/cantos:start` | Adopts the Cantos orchestrator for the **current session only**, reading the bundled system in place. Writes nothing. | A quick try, or a one-off you don't want to scaffold. |

## See it in action

Install it, then in any project (a fresh, empty folder is cleanest):

```text
> /cantos:init

Scaffolding the Cantos system here... done. CLAUDE.md, .assistants/, workflows/,
references/, and registry/ are now real files in your project.

Before I route anything, let me set the system up for you. A few quick questions:

  What do you work on, and what should I optimize for?
  > Founder building a fintech app. Ship fast, protect my focus time.

  Where does your work live (docs, tasks, code, comms)?
  > Linear, GitHub, Notion, Gmail.

  Which starter assistants do you want? (research/writing, admin, engineering)
  > Keep all three, rename the engineer to "ship".

Done. context/me.md and context/work.md written, assistants tuned, marker cleared.
```

From then on, every session you start in that folder begins as Cantos, and it routes each request to the assistant that owns it:

```text
> draft a cold email to a design partner and hold 30 minutes tomorrow to call them

Routing to lyren (admin). Drafting the email and proposing a calendar hold.
I'll show you both and wait for your OK before sending or creating anything.
```

Prefer not to scaffold? Run `/cantos:start` and it acts as the orchestrator for that one session, reading the bundled system in place and writing nothing.

## What "self-improving" means

Cantos is built to sharpen over time instead of decaying. Every session can fold what it learned back into its own instructions: `/wrap` reviews the conversation and updates the relevant brain file, workflow, or the registry, routed through a three-question test that keeps the instructions short instead of letting rules pile up. That loop only persists when the files are real on disk, which is why `/cantos:init` (not the ephemeral `/cantos:start`) is the way to actually live in the system.

## What's bundled

- **The orchestrator + specialist assistants** (research and writing, admin via MCP, engineering) and their sub-agents, under `system/`.
- **Skills**, surfaced in every session: design and UI, motion, frontend engineering, codebase architecture, research, and writing-craft. A few system-coupled skills (`wrap`, `name-session`, `write-like-me`, `ai-detect`, `impeccable`) are not exposed as standalone plugin skills because they need the scaffolded system to work; they ship inside `system/` and activate after `/cantos:init`.
- **The `browser-agent`** for general browser automation (pair with the `playwright-cli` skill).

## Security and transparency

Everything the plugin runs is plain, readable markdown and shell — no compiled binaries, no black boxes.

- **The only code that runs automatically is the SessionStart hook** (`hooks/session-start`, fully commented). It reads your project's `CLAUDE.md` to decide whether to stay silent, prints a one-line usage notice, and exits. It makes **no network calls** and **writes no files**.
- **`/cantos:init` writes files only into the project directory you run it in** — never to shared or system locations, and nothing outside that directory. It first lists exactly what it will create, **refuses if any name collides** with an existing file, and asks you to confirm before writing.
- **Network calls:** the assistants use Claude Code's built-in web search/fetch (Anthropic) for research. Two bundled tools reach other servers, and **only when you explicitly run them**: `system/tools/cantos/flux.py` (image generation via the NVIDIA NIM API, with your own key) and the opt-in, unwired `system/tools/cantos/brain_update_hook.py` (Anthropic API). Neither runs on its own.
- **No telemetry.** The plugin gathers and sends nothing about you or your usage.
- **No elevated permissions.** It does not require or request `--dangerously-skip-permissions` / bypass-permissions mode.

## Privacy

After `/cantos:init`, the scaffolded system holds your personal context (`context/me.md`, `context/work.md`) and, if you use the voice features, your writing samples. Keep that project in a **private** repo. The plugin itself ships no personal data.
